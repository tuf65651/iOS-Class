iOS Application for synchronization of Outlook Appointments with iPhone Calendar.

## Microsoft Client Code
My Outlook client is taken from code provided by Microsoft. All code in this project is mine, unless the top indicates that I took it from Microsoft. I got it from the repo at https://github.com/jasonjoh/swift-tutorial.
